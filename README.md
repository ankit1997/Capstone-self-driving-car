# Capstone-self-driving-car
Repo for capstone project - "Semi autonomous self driving car"
This repo contains the software source code for the self-driving car project. 
The auto-steering mode is implemented using an end-to-end convolution model, inspired by End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316)
